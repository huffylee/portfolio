    <h2>“What is your story?”</h2>
    <h4>I am a user experience designer from the Pacific Northwest who is passionate about combining the elements of <em>art & science.</em></h4>
  <p>My love for science & research came from my years of studying Biology at the University of Washington. From that experience, I learned to keep an open mind & enjoy the research process of data collection. Alongside with my studies, I have always maintained my passion for the arts by being a visual artist. I have participated in local art shows that support local businesses & done interviews for art magazines. All of these have been wonderful learning experiences that have kept me motivated to stay creative.
<br>
<br>
Fast forward to today, I am a certified UX professional with a diploma from the UX Design Institute & Glasgow Caledonian University. My professional goal now is to take my 4+ years experience working in the problem solving sector of clinical science lab & apply it with my new design learning to <em>help users everywhere.</em></p>
